Project Overview : 
This repository contains a detailed analysis and visualization of the Titanic dataset, aiming to explore various factors that affected the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic and to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival

Dataset Description: 
The dataset includes the following columns:​

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.​
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).​
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).​
